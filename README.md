Max31855 thermocouple for Raspberry pi - Python

I am currently using Occidentalis v0.2 from adafruit http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-educational-linux-distro/occidentalis-v0-dot-2

As this is my first program in python it is rough. 

for beginners:
you can import this module in python - "import thermocouple.py"
and then call either thermocouple.getExternal(0) or thermocouple.getInternal(0) this will report the temperatures respectively 
this is assuming you are using SPI channel 0
